		I am from Wisconsin. Here is some more information about Wisconsin, in case you know nothing about it. <br>
		<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin">
			<cite>Wisconsin</cite><br>
			The state is one of the nation's leading dairy producers and is known as "America's Dairyland"; it is particularly famous for its cheese. The state is also famous for its beer, particularly and historically in Milwaukee, most notably as the headquarters of the Miller Brewing Company. Wisconsin has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the country and is well known for its drinking culture. Its economy is dominated by manufacturing, healthcare, information technology, and agricultureâ€”specifically dairy, cranberries and ginseng. Tourism is also a major contributor to the state's economy.
